Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the design ,development, testing and maintenance of software systems 
it has helped in creation of high-quality software that underpins the mordern word 
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.The software crisisi-during this milestone it led to development of software engineering as a formal discipline
2.The Agile manifesto-this milestone revolutionalised software engineering leading to more successful projects outcomes and faster deliverly
3. The rise of devops- this milestone anabled automation leading to more reliable softwares deliverly

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. design-it lays the foundation of the development process
2. development-the creation of the software starts following the design documents
3. Testing-this involves ensuring that the software works as intendend
4. Deployment-the  software in this face is deployed into actual use and made available to users
5. Maintenance- the software is monitored and and modified where need be to fit the users preferences 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

waterfall methodology has a low flexibility compared to high frexibility in agile methodologies 
waterfall methodology has a fixed preditermined project sccope while the agile has evolving adaptable 
waterfall can be used in government projects ,large scale infrastructure projects
agile methodology can be used in innovative projects ,software product development
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software deveeloper -code ipmlementation,troubleshoooting
quality assurance engineer-testing of software ,efect indentification ,process improvement
project manager-project planning,team cordination ,resource management

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
integrated development systems -enhanced productivity,code assistance,project management
example virtual studio code,eclipse
version control system -keeps code histoly,enable a number of developers to  work on the same code base 
example of VCS-git, subversion ,

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1.performance issues,,this challege can be overcome by use of profiling tools and monitoring 
2. poor communication between team members ,this can be overcome by regural meetings and clear documentation of project requirement 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing-this is the test of each unit indipendently,,it has the importance of the following ,early detection of failures ,improves quality codes 
integratin testing-this involves testing of different componets of the application it has the following importance detect interface issue,ensure proper integration 
system testing-it involves the testing the complete and intergrated software system as a whole ,impotance detect system level issue 
acceptance testing-it helps verify that the software meets the business requirement and its ready for deployment ,impotance validates business requirements

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
This is the practice of desighning and refining prompts -inputs to AI models to enhance accurate and useful models 
it has the following advantages 
improves clarity
optimize output quality
enhance efficiency

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Types of cars " improved "explain the key difference between electric cars and tradition gasoline cars " this give clarity on the answers
